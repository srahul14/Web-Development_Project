Alappuzha is a Land Mark between the broad Arabian sea and a net work of rivers flowing into it.
<BR> In the early first decade of the 20th Century the then Viceroy of the Indian Empire, Lord Curzon made a visit in the State to Alleppey now Alappuzha.
<BR> Fascinated by the Scenic beauty of the place, in joy and amazement, he said, “Here nature has spent up on the land her richest bounties”.
<BR> In his exhilaration, it is said, he exclaimed, “Alleppey, the Venice of the East”.
<BR> Thus the sobriquet found its place in the world Tourism Map.
<BR> The presence of a port and a pier, criss -cross roads and numerous bridges across them, a long and unbroken sea coast might have motivated him to make this comparison<BR>
