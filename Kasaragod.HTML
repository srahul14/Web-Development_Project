Kasargod, the land of seven languages and several cultures.<br>
 The name, Kasaragod, is said to be derived from the word Kusirakood meaning Nuxvomica forests (Kanjirakuttom).<br>
 Kasaragod district was formed on May 24. 1984, with the intention of bestowing maximum attention on the development of backward areas.<br>
 With the formation of the new district, comprising the erstwhile Kasaragod and Hosdurg taluks, it has become possible to develop this coastal area fruitfully.
