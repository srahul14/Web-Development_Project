<FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS">Ernakulam is the green commercial capital of Kerala with one of the finest natural harbours in the world.
<BR> From here, ships set sail for foreign ports with pepper, sea food, rubber and coir.
<BR> From times immemorial, Arabs, Chinese, Dutch, British and Portuguese seafarers followed the sea route to Cochin and left their impression in the town. 
<BR>The harbour is the nucleus around which Cochin has grown to become the Queen of the Arabian Sea.
