Set high in the ranges of the Western Ghats, in Kerala, is the Periyar National Park and Tiger Reserve.<br>
 The park has a picturesque lake at the heart of the sanctuary.<br>
 Formed with the building of a dam in 1895, this reservoir meanders around the contours of the wooded hills, providing a perennial source of water for the local wildlife.<br>
 Herds of elephant and sambar, gaur and wild pigs wander down to the lakeside and can be observed from the launches that cruise the lake.<br>
 In March and April, during the driest period here, the animals spend a lot of time near the lake and the elephants can be seen bathing and swimming in the reservoir.<br>
